# pygame-isometric-platformer

Playing around with pygame in my spare time, I wanted to challenge myself by implementing a simple isometric style platformer using only pygame's limited functionality.
Implemented with an array of tilemaps, coming together to form a 3D map of cubes. Utilised pygame's 2D collision detection for each layer of tilemap and combined them into a basic 3D system. 

Run with:
```
Python iso.py
```

wasd controls, space to jump.
'f' key with mirror tilemap.
